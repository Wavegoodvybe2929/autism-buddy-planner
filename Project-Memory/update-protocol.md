# Project Memory Update Protocol

> **CRITICAL**: Project-Memory is the DYNAMIC UPDATE CENTER of the autism-buddy-planner system. All status updates, workload completion, and progress tracking must be documented here after each development activity.

## Update Protocol Overview

### **After Every Workload - MANDATORY Updates:**

1. **Update `project-overview.md`**:
   - Add completion status for completed features
   - Update current phase information
   - Document any major milestones reached
   - Update "Last Updated" date

2. **Update `development-history.md`**:
   - Add entry for significant development work
   - Document major decisions made
   - Record successful agent collaboration patterns
   - Note any issues resolved or lessons learned

3. **Update `agent-framework-summary.md`**:
   - Document successful multi-agent workflows
   - Update current phase agent coordination patterns
   - Record any workflow improvements discovered
   - Add examples of effective collaboration

## Dynamic vs Static System Architecture

### **STATIC REFERENCE DOCUMENTATION** (Never Updated for Status)
- **`Agent-Config/` folder**: Static agent workflow patterns and capabilities
- **`.github/copilot-instructions.md`**: Static development patterns and guidelines
- **Purpose**: Stable reference for how to work, not what's currently happening

### **DYNAMIC STATUS DOCUMENTATION** (Updated After Each Workload)
- **`Project-Memory/` folder**: Current status, recent progress, active priorities
- **Purpose**: Living record of what's been accomplished and what's next

## Workload Update Checklist

### **Immediately After Completing Any Development Work:**

#### **1. Project Overview Update**
```markdown
- [ ] Update "Last Updated" date to current date
- [ ] Update completion status for any completed features
- [ ] Update current development phase if changed
- [ ] Add any new completed achievements to status lists
- [ ] Update "Next Development Phases" if priorities changed
```

#### **2. Development History Update**
```markdown
- [ ] Add new entry with date and development summary
- [ ] Document key decisions made during workload
- [ ] Record successful patterns for future reference
- [ ] Note any challenges encountered and solutions found
```

#### **3. Agent Framework Update (if agents were used)**
```markdown
- [ ] Document which agents collaborated successfully
- [ ] Record effective workflow patterns discovered
- [ ] Update current phase coordination examples
- [ ] Add any improvements to agent collaboration
```

#### **4. Technical Architecture Update (if architecture changed)**
```markdown
- [ ] Update component analysis if new components added
- [ ] Document any new patterns established
- [ ] Update dependency information if packages changed
```

## Update Frequency Guidelines

### **Required Updates:**
- **After feature completion**: Always update project-overview.md
- **After significant development sessions**: Update development-history.md
- **After multi-agent workflows**: Update agent-framework-summary.md
- **After architecture changes**: Update technical-architecture.md

### **Update Timing:**
- **Immediately after work completion**: Don't delay updates
- **Before switching contexts**: Update before moving to different work
- **End of development sessions**: Ensure all progress is documented

## Quality Standards for Updates

### **Content Requirements:**
- **Specific and actionable**: Avoid vague descriptions
- **Date-stamped**: Always include when work was completed
- **Community-focused**: Document autism community impact
- **Technical accuracy**: Ensure technical details are precise

### **Consistency Standards:**
- **Use consistent formatting**: Follow existing patterns
- **Update all related sections**: Don't create inconsistencies
- **Cross-reference appropriately**: Link to related achievements
- **Maintain chronological order**: Keep timeline accurate

## Emergency Update Protocol

### **For Critical Issues or Major Breakthroughs:**
1. **Immediate project-overview.md update** with critical status
2. **Emergency development-history.md entry** with full context
3. **Agent coordination documentation** if multiple agents involved
4. **Technical architecture update** if system changes made

## Validation Checklist

### **Before Considering Updates Complete:**
```markdown
- [ ] All completed work is documented in project-memory
- [ ] Dates are current and accurate across all files
- [ ] Status sections reflect actual completion state
- [ ] Any new patterns or lessons are captured
- [ ] Cross-references between files are maintained
- [ ] Community benefit is clearly documented
```

**Remember**: Project-Memory is the single source of truth for project status. Agent-Config and copilot-instructions provide stable workflows, but Project-Memory tracks what's actually happening and what's been accomplished.
