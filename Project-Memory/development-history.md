- Offline reliability eliminating internet dependency concerns
- Cross-platform distribution (macOS, Windows, Linux)
- Enhanced privacy with local-first data storage

**Technical Approach - Tauri Integration**:
- **Framework Choice**: Tauri v2 for React/Rust hybrid architecture
- **Preservation Strategy**: Maintain existing React codebase and autism-friendly components
- **Enhanced Features**: Desktop-specific accessibility, system integration, offline capabilities
- **Agent Coordination**: Frontend architecture + React TypeScript specialists leading implementation

**Implementation Milestones Planned**:
1. Environment setup (Rust, Tauri CLI, development tools)
2. Tauri configuration with custom app icon integration
3. Desktop-specific accessibility enhancements
4. Cross-platform build and distribution setup
5. Enhanced system integration features (notifications, window management)

**Desktop-Specific Enhancements Planned**:
- **Native Window Management**: Predictable window behavior for routine consistency
