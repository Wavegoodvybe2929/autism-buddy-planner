## Autism Community Requirements Framework

### Core Design Principles
1. **Predictability First**: Every interaction should behave consistently and expectedly
2. **Sensory Sensitivity**: All visual and auditory elements should be gentle and non-overwhelming
3. **Clear Communication**: Language and instructions should be direct, specific, and unambiguous
4. **User Control**: Users should have control over their sensory and interaction experience
5. **Routine Support**: The app should reinforce rather than disrupt established patterns

### Sensory Considerations

#### **Visual Sensory Guidelines**
```markdown
# Visual Design Requirements for Autism Community

## Color and Contrast
- **Calming Color Palette**: Soft blues, greens, and neutral tones
- **High Contrast Options**: User-selectable high contrast modes

- **Minimal Animation**: Smooth, purposeful transitions only (≤300ms)
- **Optional Motion**: User control to disable all animations
- **Predictable Movement**: No sudden, unexpected visual changes
- **Calm Interactions**: Gentle hover effects and state changes

## Information Density
- **Clean Layouts**: Plenty of white space, uncluttered design
- **Clear Visual Hierarchy**: Obvious information organization
- **Large Touch Targets**: Minimum 44px touch targets for accessibility
- **Consistent Patterns**: Identical elements look and behave the same way
```

#### **Interaction Design Guidelines**
